# Godot with GDScript, basics
This repository contains the basics of Godot and GDScript you need to get started with a Godot project.

## Purpose of this repository
This repository has been created for the "Pelikehityksen perusteet" online course organised by TAMK and VAMK for first-year Business Information Systems students. The repository will be maintained and made available after the course for continued use as an introduction to game development with Godot.

This repository is intended for those interested in game development. It assumes basic programming knowledge, which any introductory programming course can provide.
